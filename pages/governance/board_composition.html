            As a global, diverse consumer products company, we strive to reflect the diversity of our workforce and

            leadership skills and experiences, they represent a mix of background, age, gender, race and life
            experience that informs their leadership and strengthens their oversight.

                    The Company’s Board retains discretion to determine whether the same individual should serve as
                    both
                    Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chairman of the Board or whether the roles should be
                    separated.
                    This
                    approach allows the Board to use its considerable experience and knowledge to elect the most
                    qualified
                    Director as Chairman of the Board, while maintaining the ability to separate the Chairman of the
                    Board
                    and CEO roles when appropriate, as the roles have been in previous periods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Board regularly considers this discretionary structure and whether to combine or separate
                    the
                    roles,
                    depending on which leadership structure best serves the Company and its shareholders. The Board
                    believes
                    this discretion, including the flexibility to make this determination at any given point, best
                    enables
                    it to promote the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders.
