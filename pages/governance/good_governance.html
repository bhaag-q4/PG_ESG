                When we first established our Citizenship focus areas several years ago, we included Ethics & Corporate
                Responsibility as a separate focus. But what became clear over time is that Ethics & Corporate
                Responsibility is the foundation for all our citizenship work — the base from which it all builds —
                rather than a separate focus area. From long experience, we know that a sustainably strong business
                depends on maintaining strong ethical, compliance and quality standards. It is equally true that for all
                our citizenship work to be credible and impactful, it must be firmly rooted in our Purpose, Values and
                Principles.

                We believe that strong governance practices contribute to better results for shareholders. We maintain
                governance principles, policies and practices that support Board and management accountability and serve
                the
                best interests of our Company, our shareholders, and our many stakeholders. We also promote good
                governance
                through our public support of Commonsense Principles 2.0 and our compliance with the Corporate
                Governance

            <div class="shareholder-engagement_blurb">
                We value our relationships with all our shareholders. Engagement builds mutual understanding and a basis
                for progress, and the input we receive from them impacts and informs our corporate practices. The
                Company’s top 100 institutional shareholders collectively own over 50% of the Company’s outstanding
                shares of common stock, and we generally focus our proactive shareholder outreach efforts on these
                shareholders. These engagements have included members of our senior management, investor relations team,
                and subject matter experts from the Company, as well as Directors. We also solicit off-cycle, follow-up
                engagements where we believe further discussion and feedback on our actions would be beneficial. Our
                team is available via investor relations contact and CSO contact.
