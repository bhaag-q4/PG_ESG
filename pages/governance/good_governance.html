                At P&G, we serve nearly five billion people around the world with one of the strongest portfolios of
                trusted, quality, and leadership brands. How we serve the world’s consumers matters, and we have
                committed – publicly and within – to doing what is right and to being a good corporate citizen. A
                sustainably strong business depends on maintaining trust, and that requires adopting strong ethical and
                compliance standards and ensuring strong Board leadership and oversight. That is why Good Governance is
                the foundation for everything we do, including our Citizenship work — the base from which it all builds
                — rather than a separate focus area. From long experience, we know that a sustainably strong business
                depends on maintaining strong ethical, compliance and quality standards. It is equally true that for all
                our citizenship work to be credible and impactful, it must be firmly rooted in our Purpose, Values and
                Principles.

                the
                best interests of our Company, our shareholders, and our many stakeholders. We also promote good

                We value our relationships with all our shareholders. Engagement builds mutual understanding and a basis
                for progress, and the input we receive from them impacts and informs our corporate practices. The
                Company’s top 100 institutional shareholders collectively own over 50% of the Company’s outstanding
                shares of common stock, and we generally focus our proactive shareholder outreach efforts on these
                shareholders. These engagements have included members of our senior management, investor relations team,
                and subject matter experts from the Company, as well as Directors. We also solicit off-cycle, follow-up
                engagements where we believe further discussion and feedback on our actions would be beneficial. Our
                team is available via
