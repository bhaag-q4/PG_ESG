            <p>
                Almost all of our Scope 3 emissions come from just four categories — purchased goods and services,
                upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, use of sold product, and end of life treatment
                of sold product. Of these, the “use phase” of our products, especially those that use hot water during
                consumer use, is our single greatest opportunity for Scope 3 emissions.
                Given these four categories account for more than 99% of Scope 3 emissions, we focused this year’s data
                update on those categories and derived new estimates for them using life cycle assessment (LCA) data and
                calendar year 2019 production volumes. Findings were consistent with prior years, indicating consumer
                use of our products remains our greatest opportunity area. The business travel estimate includes
                commercial airline travel by employees that was managed by our primary outside travel agencies. Travel
                arranged by other agencies was not covered in the calculation
