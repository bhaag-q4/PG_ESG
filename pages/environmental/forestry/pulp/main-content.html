                                    The use of recycled fibers is part of P&G's circular economy efforts. Circularity
                                    has always been a part of our ongoing conservation
                                    and environmental footprint reduction efforts within water, waste and renewable
                                    energy. We are committed to develop a more circular
                                    end-to-end supply chain by 2030. To achieve this, one of many steps we are taking is
                                    a commitment to 100% recycled or recyclable
                                    packaging by 2030.

                                    Also, P&G Family Care is committed to using 100% recycled fiber in its fiber-based
                                    packaging by 2023. Today, we are at 98% recycled
                                    fibers. We use recycled paper in our inner cores and paper-based packaging, its best
                                    and most efficient use. Why not use recycled
                                    fibers in our tissue and towel products? There are significant trade-offs with
                                    recycled tissue quality, which causes people to use
                                    more product. Also, recycled fiber tissue mills result in considerably larger amount
                                    of solid waste, energy usage, water use, and
                                    potential contaminants.

                                    All premium, at-home tissue brands (the market P&G competes in) sold in the U.S. use
                                    100% virgin fibers. With that said, P&G has improved Charmin's strength and
                                    absorbency, so today, people can use less paper per task with our tissue products

                                            Plantation forests are a type of managed forest in which the trees are
                                            planted (as opposed to naturally regenerated), of
                                            the same age and generally of the same species and are intended to maximize
                                            the production of wood fiber. Multi‐purpose
                                            plantations, designed to meet a wide variety of social, economic, and
                                            environmental objectives, can provide key ecosystem
                                            services, help preserve the world's remaining primary forests, and sequester
                                            an important proportion of the atmospheric carbon
                                            released by humans over the past 300 years. Because forest plantations grow
                                            much faster than natural forests, forest plantations
                                            are an increasingly important source of timber supply. Plantations make up a

                                    The use of non-wood fibers has been part of P&G's development program for more than
                                    two decades. This work includes creating products with premium softness, strength,
                                    and absorbency while delivering products at scale and with a positive sustainability
                                    footprint. The non-woods fibers available today would result in reduced product
                                    benefit and consumer experience. We are committed to continued development, so a
                                    consumer trade-off is not required. Also, none of the non-wood fibers available
                                    today have established supply chains at the scale needed by P&G. With that said, we
                                    are committed to continued investment as the work to bring these products to market
                                    at quality and scale is significant. And importantly, we aim to ensure that these
                                    fibers are responsibly sourced using 3rd party certification systems.

                                    wood fibers. Our goal is to discover a non-wood fiber that is:
                                    1) consumer-preferred, 2) able to be produced at scale and 3) responsibly sourced
                                    using third-party certification.</li>

                                    of Canadian forests are harvested and regrown annually for all industries, including
                                    the predominant lumber industry. Beyond the requirements of
                                    the three forest certification schemes referenced above, Canada has rigorous
                                    forestry policies. They mandate these forests to be harvested responsibly without
                                    any deforestation.

                                    According to the Canadian government (Natural Resources Canada), human activity in
                                    Canada's managed forests sequestered 20 million tons of carbon;
                                    it did not result in any net release of carbon. In fact, a recent NRC report
                                    indicates Canada's forests to be a net carbon emitter due to large-scale
                                    natural disturbances (forest fires, insects, etc.), not human activity.

                                            P&G was a founding member of the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement (CBFA)
                                            signed in 2010, a historic agreement covering more than 72 million
                                            hectares of public forests. Changing economic realities and heightened
                                            public and marketplace concern over environmental issues had created
                                            opportunities for Canada's forest industry and environmental organizations.
                                            From these challenges came a unique collaboration between 21 major
                                            Canadian forest products companies and nine leading environmental
                                            organizations. The agreement committed signatories to achieving strategic
                                            goals
                                            that addressed environmental and economic sustainability in the Boreal
                                            forest. Yet, this coalition was not enough. All parties acknowledged that
                                            changes are needed to create a more effective and responsive implementation
                                            model that will engage proactively with local communities, provincial
                                            governments, First Nations, and other non-signatory environmental groups who
                                            share our commitment. So while the CBFA is not in existence today,
                                            the CBFA continues to be a model for a future cooperative conservation

                                        All animals and plants play vital roles in the balance of their local
                                        ecosystems. If any were to go extinct, ecosystems could have significant
                                        negative impacts. It's important to protect those species that are threated or
                                        endangered. P&G's requirements for all pulp fiber to be third party
                                        certified helps protect and restore threatened and endangered species. FSC's
                                        standard directly states that companies "shall protect rare species and

                                        is very important especially for Indigenous Groups. P&G's use of PEFC
                                        and FSC certification ensures Indigenous Peoples rights are respected through
                                        the completion of the Free, Prior, and Informed Consent process. All
                                        national FSC standards are required to "recognize and uphold the rights, custom
                                        and culture of Indigenous Peoples as defined in the United Nations
                                        Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples" (<a

                                        This requires companies to "identify and uphold Indigenous Peoples legal and
                                        customary rights
                                        of ownership." PEFC similarly says forest practices should use a framework to
                                        ensure Indigenous rights are respected suggesting the use of the U.N.

                                        High conservation values are any characteristics that make an area unique or
                                        special. They could be sites of archeological, cultural, and environmental
                                        significance. Examples are habitats to protect the endangered red-cockaded
                                        woodpecker, cemeteries, a watershed that is the source for water for entire
                                        communities, or traditional hunting grounds of Indigenous Peoples. P&G's belief
                                        in third-party certification standard ensures HCVs are properly identified
                                        and protected. PEFC's standard says certified companies shall "identify,
                                        protect, conserve or set aside ecologically important forest areas"

                                        FSC's global

                                        The forestry certification systems require prompt action taken to regenerate
                                        forest cover to pre-harvest conditions, ensuring the same quality and quantity
                                        of the forest resources. FSC directly address regeneration and planting by
                                        requiring companies "by natural or artificial regeneration methods, regenerate
                                        vegetation cover in a timely fashion to pre-harvesting or more natural

                                        Further, FSC certified companies "shall use species for regeneration that are
                                        ecologically well adapted to the site and management objectives"

                                        The PEFC standard "requires that successful regeneration shall be ensured
                                        through natural regeneration or planting that is adequate to ensure the quantity
