                2021,
                going forward we will update 3 times per year The latest is available here.

                <p>P&G defines a grievance related to palm oils as any complaint, allegation or concern we receive or
                    identify that is inconsistent with: P&G’s Supplier Expectation, our Responsible Palm Sourcing Policy
                    or
                    any relevant P&G corporate policies on governance and human rights. Grievances may cover both
                    environmental
                    and social concerns.</p>

            <p>As part of P&G’s commitment to a speak-up culture, since 1992, P&G has maintained an avenue for employees to
                report concerns regarding violations which are against the law or P&G’s policies. In 2004 P&G expanded
                the system to allow those inside and outside P&G to raise grievance concerns.

            <p> We encourage anyone who has identified a potential concern to report it to us.

                    to deploy satellite/mapping technology to allow us to enhance
                    our ability to track deforestation, development on peat and fires in our supplier enterprise-wide
                    supply chains.</p>
                <p>The system is based on the use of aerial/satellite imagery, concession maps and knowledge of
                    high-conservation value (HCV)/high-carbon-stock (HCS) areas. A key feature of this system is its
                    accuracy, level of precision and timeliness of the tracking system at a supplier group level. This
                    enables us to quickly identify the emergence of a potential concern and act to halt any destructive
                    land-use practise and drive for timely resolution of conflicts. </p>
                <p>The combination of analytical capacity and big data has made the Earthqualizer system a useful tool
                    to help monitor the No Deforestation and Peat (NDP) elements of our P&G Palm Policy and Supplier
                    Expectation..
                    This technology will enable us to monitor palm oil concessions owned by companies inside our supply
