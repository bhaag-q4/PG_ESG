            <h4>Benefits of Oil Palm: An Efficient, Versatile Productive Crop</h4>
            <p>
                Palm Oils are produced from the fruit of the palm tree: one of the most land use efficient crops, it is versatile, productive, and easy to cultivate
            </p>
            <ul class="custom-ul">
                <li>Approximately 6 million people rely on palm for their livelihoods</li>
                <li>40% of palm globally is grown by smallholder farmers – it's easy cultivation and year-round productivity make it appealing for smallholder (RSPO definition &lt;50 hectares land ownership)</li>
                <li>30-35% of the world's vegetable oil is palm yet it is grown on only 10% of the land used to produce vegetable oils</li>
                <li>Palm Oil is 4x more productive* than the next best vegetable oil (Soy, Rapeseed) and up to 10x more productive than Coconut, Sunflower</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Oil palm is cultivated in the “Tropics or Equatorial Zone an ecologically important, biodiverse and sensitive zone. The rapid development of palm plantations in the last 20 years has in some cases involved:

            <h4> Concerns: Palm Alternatives</h4>
            <p>
                P&G acknowledges the complexities and concerns related to the use of palm-based ingredients. Many stakeholders recognise that there is no obvious single straightforward solution or option. Alternate sourcing options for ingredients often present different dilemmas e.g.  use of petroleum-based synthetics, animal derived materials or less land efficient vegetable oils. The challenge is that these choices may result in unintended consequences – rather than resolving concerns and they may potentially create new or worse issues
