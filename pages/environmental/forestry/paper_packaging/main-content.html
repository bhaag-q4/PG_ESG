                We continually strive to optimize our packaging design, aiming to use the least amount of material, while ensuring adequate protection, delivery and safe use of our products. As part of our ongoing efforts, we continue to identify source reduction opportunities to decrease overall material usage and to use recycled paper when it offers the best option to meet performance and business requirements. Our paper-based packaging is derived from wood fiber, and we have a responsibility through our procurement practices to ensure that the wood fiber in our packaging has been responsibly sourced.

            <p>
                We have an aim that 100% of our paper packaging will contain either recycled or third-party certified virgin content. Over the past several years, we have expanded our efforts to collect data from an increased number of suppliers to assess progress against this goal. In 2020, we received data from more than 120 suppliers representing more than 98% of our global paper packaging spend.

            <p>
                Typically, virgin fiber used for paper and board production is from timber that are usually by-products
                from lumber and unlikely to be used for other purposes. Once this virgin fiber has been made into paper,
                it can be recycled on average five to seven times. Recycled paper and board are a crucial part of
                achieving our Ambition 2030 goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also recycle 'post-industrial' waste. This is material that, for one reason or another, was not used
                directly for packaging. The most common form is 'clippings' – waste generated when packaging is cut to
                shape.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though we do not own or manage forests, we have a responsibility through our procurement practices to
                ensure the sustainability of the world's forest resources. To deliver on this commitment, P&G now has a
                <a href="#">Paper Packaging Sourcing Policy</a> to set supplier expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to our Paper Packaging Sourcing Policy, we work with our suppliers and other stakeholders to promote forest certification through our purchases.
                We give preference to the Forest Stewardship Council and accept Sustainable Forestry Initiative
                and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification who ensure forests are responsibly managed.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we go forward, our objective is to achieve 100% use of recycled or third-party certified virgin fiber
                in our paper packaging by 2022 and maintain this goal ongoing. We will continue to report data on our
                paper packaging on an annual basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, P&G will now share on an annual basis our paper packaging suppliers. We believe that transparency
                helps us to build a more sustainable supply chain. Our direct supplier list accounts for in excess of
                98% of the wood fiber-based packaging P&G purchased in 2020. This list includes all corrugate, folding
                cartons, displays, paper labels, and packaging.
