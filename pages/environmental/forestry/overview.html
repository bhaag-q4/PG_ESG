                Perspective on Forestry
            </h4>
            <p>
                Forests are critical to supporting virtually all life on earth. Increases in world population and
                pressure from economic demands are increasing threats to the world’s forests. These threats are
                especially high in tropical regions where deforestation and loss of high-conservation-value areas are
                already occurring. The good news is that forests are one of our most-renewable resources and by
                collaborating with numerous private and public sector organizations we can make progress in achieving
                our zero net deforestation goals and protecting habitat which benefits people, business, wildlife and
                local economies.

                    Our efforts are based on our commitment to ensure the responsible management of the world's forests
                    and our conscientious use of forest products. Although we do not own or manage commercial forests,
                    many of our products and packages are dependent on raw materials from the forest-based supply
                    chains. Therefore, we recognize the key role we must play through our procurement and manufacturing
                    practices to ensure the sustainability of the world's forest resources.

                    Wood pulp for tissue/towel and absorbent hygiene products, wood fibers used in paper packaging, and
                    palm oil for our laundry and beauty products are strategic commodities where our sourcing practices
                    can have the greatest impact on ensuring responsible use of the world's forest resources. Each of
                    these materials has a different supply chain, and their unique complexities led us to develop
                    individual programs as described in the following sections:
