                    Packaging plays an essential role in delivering products to our consumers. Product protection,
                    consumer safety, ease of use, and communication of safety and use information to consumers are just
                    some of the critical functions packaging delivers. As we work to ensure our packaging delivers
                    against key performance criteria, we also seek to drive greater circularity of our packaging at end
                    of life and are working towards 100% recyclable or reusable packaging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plastic is one of the materials used in our packaging. Plastic packaging can deliver meaningful
                    benefits in terms of material reductions, product protection, and reductions in greenhouse gas
                    emissions from transportation. While plastic packaging drives meaningful benefits, research and data
                    has shown that over 8 million metric tons of plastic is leaking into our rivers and oceans each year
                    and that overall recycling rates for plastic globally are low. Addressing this challenge and driving
                    greater circularity for plastics will require collaboration across multiple stakeholders including
                    industry, governments, civil society, and academics.

            <ul class="custom-ul">
                <li>The scope of this goal includes consumer packaging only, as this is what we believe is most meaningful to drive change in our industry. Shippers and boxes that transport products to our retailers, which are predominantly widely-collected and recycled cardboard corrugate, are not included in our tracking. On this basis, our percentage of recyclable or reusable consumer packaging is currently about 55%.</li>
                <li>Flexible films are a key material class for P&G consumer packaging as they enable significant source reduction but today have limited recyclability.  We are working to improve the recyclability of these films by moving to recyclable formats when feasible and partnering with several groups to increase curbside collection of flexible films.</li>
                <li>We are also advancing efforts on reusable packaging. Examples include <a href="#">LOOP, Refillable Hair Care Bottles, Olay Whips Refill</a>.</li>

                <li>We plan to achieve this goal by continuing to lightweight packaging, increasing our use of recycled content, encouraging consumer conversion to more efficient product forms and when appropriate, using alternatives to plastic.</li>
                <li>As of June 30, 2020, we had reduced our use of virgin petroleum plastic by 4% vs. our 2017 baseline.</li>
