                    Packaging plays an essential role in delivering products to our consumers. Product protection,
                    consumer safety, ease of use, and communication of safety and use information to consumers are just
                    some of the critical functions packaging delivers. As we work to ensure our packaging delivers
                    against key performance criteria, we also seek to drive greater circularity of our packaging at end
                    of life and are working towards 100% recyclable or reusable packaging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plastic is one of the materials used in our packaging. Plastic packaging can deliver meaningful
                    benefits in terms of material reductions, product protection, and reductions in greenhouse gas
                    emissions from transportation. At P&G we’re concerned that plastic waste in our environment is a
                    serious problem, especially when it ends up in our rivers and oceans. It’s a complex global
                    challenge that requires a comprehensive, collaborative approach across the entire plastics
                    lifecycle. Addressing this challenge and driving
                    greater circularity for plastics will require collaboration across multiple stakeholders including
                    industry, governments, civil society, and academics.

            <ul class="custom-ul">
                <li>The scope of this goal includes consumer packaging only, as this is what we believe is most meaningful to drive change in our industry. Shippers and boxes that transport products to our retailers, which are predominantly widely-collected and recycled cardboard corrugate, are not included in our tracking. On this basis, our percentage of recyclable or reusable consumer packaging is currently about 55%.</li>
                <li>Flexible films are a key material class for P&G consumer packaging as they enable significant source reduction but today have limited recyclability.  We are working to improve the recyclability of these films by moving to recyclable formats when feasible and partnering with several groups to increase curbside collection of flexible films.</li>
                <li>We are also advancing efforts on reusable packaging.

                    <li>
                        P&G does not include compostable or biodegradable packaging in our goals.  We understand that there are issues with consumer access to facilities that can properly treat compostable packaging and that these materials are potentially contaminants to the established recycling streams for plastics.  Our objective is to help enable a circular economy through reuse and recycling of packaging.

                <div class="custom-ul">
                    <li>
                        P&G considers packaging to be recyclable if there is at-scale collection, sorting, processing, and end markets for the material and format in at least one geography.  We do not consider waste to energy and conversion to fuels as suitable end markets to satisfy this definition.
