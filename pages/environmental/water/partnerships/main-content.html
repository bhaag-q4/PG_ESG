            <p>
                The Aqueduct Alliance brings together leading companies, governments, and foundations to gain strategic
                guidance and industry insight from the WRI Water Team. P&G has been an active member since 2013. The WRI
                Aqueduct team is an integral partner in assessing exposure to water risk over time.

            <p>
                The Alliance for Water Stewardship is a global membership collaboration bringing companies, NGOs, and
                the public sector together to contribute to the sustainability of local water resources. We have applied
                the AWS framework at our sites exposed to high water risk and developed site-specific water stewardship
                action plan. P&G has been a member since 2018

            <h4 class="title--arrow">California Water Action Collaborative (CWAC) – Member</h4>
            <p>
                Five of our 18 priority basins are in the western U.S., and the majority of those are in the state of
                California. There is already a lot of great work going on within the state to protect and enhance
                California’s water resources. In order to contribute to these efforts, we joined a platform of diverse
                stakeholders who came together to pursue collective action projects that will improve water security in
                California. The California Water Action Collaborative (CWAC) was created in 2014 and is focused on
                building social capital for improved water management, returning water to natural systems and driving
                corporate water stewardship aligned with state and global water stewardship goals. We hope that being a
                part of this multi-sector organization will enable us to make a meaningful impact in our priority basins
                in California.

            <p>
                Three of our 18 priority basins we are focusing on this next decade are in central Mexico, including the
                basin that surrounds Mexico City. Over the past year, P&G has engaged with local experts at The Nature
                Conservancy to learn more about the water issues and potential solutions in and around the city. As a
                first step towards being part of the solution, we joined the Mexico City Water Fund: Agua Capital. Agua
                Capital was created in 2018 as an innovative platform for collaboration among different sectors to
                contribute to the water security of Mexico City with emphasis on nature-based solutions. P&G, along with
                the other board members, intend to address the overexploitation of the aquifers, inefficiencies in
                infrastructure and operations, flood management and improvement of wastewater treatment and reuse.
