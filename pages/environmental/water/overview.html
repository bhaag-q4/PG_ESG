                        tools from a number of sources. In just a few years, we assessed over 130 facilities and
                        identified 24 P&G facilities located in areas exposed to high water risk – which we designate as
                        “Tier 3” sites. Tier 3 sites are required to do an in-depth water use analysis and implement
                        water stewardship action plans following the Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard 2.0. We
                        periodically update our assessments to ensure water risk levels reflect current water risk data.

                    <p>It is predicted that by 2030, there will be a 40% gap between global water supply and demand.
                        Pressure on water resources is growing, and some cities, like Cape Town, South Africa have
                        already experienced Day Zero: a day when the city nearly ran out of water and the government
                        required all four million residents to reduce their water use at home to 50L per person. Not
                        only is water essential for the daily operation of our facilities and production, it is also an
                        integral part of many of our products in the home. </p>
                    <p >Today, we know that the average home in the developed world is highly
                        inefficient, using up to 500 liters of water per person each day. Showering, laundry, cooking
                        and washing dishes in the home result in using upwards of 10% of the earth’s water supply. P&G
                        is spearheading the 50L Home Coalition to bring partners together across the entire domestic
                        water value chain, aiming to transform urban water management. The goal of the 50L Home project
                        will be to leverage technologies and innovations that enable a person to live on 50 liters of
                        water usage per day that feels like 500 liters. This effort will not only aim to save water but
                        also energy used in the home. To learn more please go to: <a class="text-small" target="_blank"

                        diverse mix of landscapes, cultures, economies and climates that make water issues complex and
                        require solutions unique to each river basin. That is why we embarked on a data-based water risk
                        assessment with expert partners at World Resources Institute (WRI), World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
                        and Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to identify the areas of the world we should focus
                        on for maximum positive impact. Using data from the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and other
                        sources, 18 priority basins across seven countries were identified as strategic for P&G based on
                        our understanding of where our consumers, suppliers and facilities are most exposed to current
                        and future water risks.</p>
