P&G partnered with multiple organizations to develop a three-tier water risk assessment process that integrated water risk assessment tools from a number of sources.   In just a few years, we assessed over 130 facilities and identified 24 P&G facilities located in areas exposed to high water risk – which we designate as “Tier 3” sites.  Tier 3 sites are required to do an in-depth water use analysis and implement water stewardship action plans following the Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard 2.0.   We periodically update our assessments to ensure water risk levels reflect current water risk data.

                    <p>This manufacturing plant, located in an area which has been experiencing water stress, developed innovative solutions to reduce freshwater use. The facility installed equipment to treat and reuse manufacturing process water effluent. Last year, the plant recycled more than 34 million liters of water, the equivalent annual water use of 860 Brazilian households. The project also inspired plant employees to implement other water sustainability measures.

The employees are committed to reducing their use of fresh water and are leveraging innovative data analytics to drive actionable insights from water meters installed throughout the site. The analysis of this data provides the plant with a daily understanding of water consumption so they can act immediately to eliminate losses. The plant can also benchmark their water efficiency performance with other sites. In the first month of operation, the site identified five projects that can improve their production adjusted water efficiency by 10%.

The site conserved more than 12 million liters of water by fixing leaks and improving cooling tower operating systems. This water savings is equivalent to the annual water use of 150 Maine households. The plant continues to work on other ideas to reduce and reuse water
