                    Much has changed in our world this year. The global pandemic has forced us to adjust our
                    habits — spending more time at home where we’re consuming more electricity, accumulating more waste and
                    using more water. While these changes were necessary, they presented an opportunity for all of us to
                    reevaluate habits and routines in the home.

                    Studies during the pandemic show that a majority of people in the U.S. and Europe would value help from
                    brands on ways to be more environmentally friendly at home. Consumers are demonstrating a renewed focus
                    on maintaining a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle for the long-term — one that can positively
                    impact our home, our community and our planet.
