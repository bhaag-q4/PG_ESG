            <p> At P&G, we aspire to create a company and a world where equality and inclusion is achievable for all.
                We are committed to honoring the individuality and unique contributions of our people and ensuring that
                every single employee shows up to work as their whole, authentic self and to feel safe in doing so.
                We believe doing so makes P&G not only a great place to work but also a stronger company since it is
                through diversity of thinking that we become more in touch and reflective of the consumers and the world
                which we serve. Externally, we have an opportunity and obligation to use our voice as a force for good
                and
                a force for growth. We believe now, more than ever, companies and organizations must remain committed
                to equity and inclusion and stay committed for a more equal world inside and outside our walls.
                We believe that the expansion of opportunity and equality leads to growth â€“ for individuals,
                communities, organizations, and whole economies.</p>
